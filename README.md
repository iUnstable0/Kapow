## How to run locally

First, you need to make sure you have `git` and `git-lfs` installed.
not sure how? search Google!

but, if you are on mac and you have homebrew then
```
brew install git-lfs
```

After you installed git-lfs, clone the repository

then cd into the repo 

and run these commands

```
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

Then install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
````

and run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn run dev
# or
pnpm run dev
# or
bun run dev
```

Build:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
# or
bun build
```

Run the production server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm start
# or
bun start
```

Should be on port 3000!
